# Redis Tutorial: How to Cache Databases Using Redis Sentinel

![redis-setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8672f5a-5f55-4752-af5e-be7a067030ed)

In the world of modern application development, performance and responsiveness are everything. This is where caching comes in. Caching is a powerful technique used to temporarily store copies of data so that future requests can be served faster.
In this article, we'll explore the fundamentals of caching, discuss various types of cache mechanisms, and take a deeper look into Redis, one of the most popular in-memory data stores used for caching today.
We'll not only cover theoretical concepts like caching strategies in databases, but also get hands-on with Redis Sentinel, a high availability solution for Redis. You'll learn how to set it up, test failover, monitor behavior using Redis Insight, and validate whether the new master node properly accepts writes after a failover.
Whether you're new to caching or looking to strengthen your understanding of Redis high availability, this article aims to provide a clear, practical path from theory to real-world application, and most importantly, we'll put theory into practice through hands-on examples that you can apply in your own environment.
